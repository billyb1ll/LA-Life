## Simple Self-Defined Function

Write a program that creates and uses a self-defined function, named `math_func`, that receives two input numbers and then calculate the output of the following equation:

```
output = (a^2) - (2*a*b) - 42
```

where `^` is the power operation. Finally, the program prints the output with TWO decimal places.

**Hint**: You may find the built-in function `double pow(double x, double y)` defined in `math.h` useful for computing `x^y`.

**Case 1**

Sample input:
```
2.5 4.12
```

Sample output:
```
-56.35
```

**Case 2**

Sample input:
```
1 17
```

Sample output:
```
