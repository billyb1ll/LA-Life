## Print a rectangle pattern

Reuse the `print_c` function from **lab9-print-sequence-characters** to write a program that prints a rectangle pattern. The program receives the number of rows, the number of columns, and a character to be printed.

**IMPORTANT**: This exercise will test whether your `print_c` function can be reused in other problems. Please make sure that the function `print_c` in this question is EXACTLY the same as the **lab9-print-sequence-characters**. Otherwise, your code will get a ZERO score.
