Write a program to toggle character (A-Z, a-z) and replace underscore ('_') with space (' ').

**Note**: To toggle character, we change the lower case character to upper case character, and vice versa**.


**Note**: To simplify the problem, you can assume that the length of the given input string in the test cases are always **less than or equal to 20 characters**.

**Case 1**

Sample input:
```
THIS_is_an_animal.
```
Sample output:
```
this IS AN ANIMAL.
```

**Case 2**

Sample input:
```
Good_Luck
```
Sample output:
```
gOOD lUCK
```

**Case 3**

Sample input:
```
ITCS_113
```
Sample output:
```
itcs 113
```
